# Superhero Character System for Code Heroes

## Concept Overview

The Superhero Character System adds a collectible and strategic layer to Code Heroes by allowing players to claim, level up, and utilize superhero and supervillain characters during weekly games. Each character provides unique abilities that enhance specific development activities, adding personalization and tactical depth to the platform.

## Core Mechanics

### Character Collection

Players build a roster of superhero and supervillain characters:

- **Initial Character**: New users receive one random starter character
- **Character Roster**: Players can collect multiple characters but activate only one per weekly game
- **Character Types**: Heroes provide positive bonuses to the player, while villains/anti-heroes can disrupt opponents
- **Universe Diversity**: Characters from DC, Marvel, and other universes create variety in abilities and strategies

### Character Acquisition Methods

Characters can be earned through various achievements:

- **Level Milestones**: Reaching certain XP levels unlocks character selection opportunities
- **Specific Achievements**: Completing targeted challenges (e.g., "Review 50 PRs" to unlock Batman)
- **Team Victory Rewards**: Winning team members receive character fragments or complete characters
- **Special Events**: Hackathons, seasonal events, or company milestones offer limited-time characters
- **Collection Completion**: Earning all characters in a "set" (e.g., all Avengers) unlocks a special character

### Weekly Buddy System

During each weekly game, players activate one character:

- **Character Selection**: At the beginning of each weekly game, players choose one character as their active "buddy"
- **Profile Integration**: The active character appears on the player's profile during the game
- **Ability Activation**: The character's special abilities are active during that week's game
- **Character XP**: The buddy character gains XP alongside the player, progressing toward its next level

### Character Progression

Characters have their own leveling system:

- **Character XP**: Earned when used as an active buddy based on player activities
- **Level Range**: Characters progress from Level 1-20
- **Ability Enhancement**: Higher levels increase the potency of character abilities
- **Visual Evolution**: Character portraits may evolve or enhance visually at certain level thresholds

### Team Synergy Bonuses

When multiple players on a team use characters from the same universe or team:

- **Avengers Synergy**: When 3+ Avengers are active on one team, all members get +5% HP
- **Justice League Synergy**: When 3+ Justice League members are active, team unlocks special "Justice" challenges for bonus HP
- **Villain Team-Up**: When 3+ villains are active on one team, they can coordinate for a major disruption once per game
- **X-Men Synergy**: Provides team with "mutation" that evolves one activity type to give progressively more HP throughout the week

## Integration with Weekly Games

The character system enhances the existing weekly team competition:

- **Team Selection Strategy**: Teams might coordinate which characters to activate for optimal synergy
- **Counter-Strategy**: Teams can select characters that counter the opposing teams' strengths
- **Character Rotation**: Players might rotate characters based on their planned activities for the week
- **Progressive Power**: Long-term players benefit from higher-level characters, but the effect is not overwhelming

## User Experience Elements

### Visual Representation

- **Collection Display**: Gallery view of all collected characters with stats and levels

### Strategic Notifications

- **Level-up Celebrations**: Special acknowledgment when characters reach new levels

## Implementation Phases

## Conclusion

The Superhero Character System builds upon Code Heroes' existing gamification foundation by adding collectible characters with strategic abilities. This system enhances the weekly team competitions, provides additional progression paths, and creates memorable moments through character collection and advancement.

By connecting development activities to superhero abilities and creating a "buddy" system that grows alongside the player, Code Heroes creates another compelling reason for developers to engage consistently with best practices in their daily work.
